# **DeFiLink: AI-Powered DeFi Automation**

DeFiLink is an intelligent, AI-powered solution designed to revolutionize decentralized finance (DeFi) operations. Built on the NAVI Protocol and powered by Suilend, DeFiLink automates key DeFi activities such as flash loans, token distribution, liquidation monitoring, and more—all through a simple WhatsApp interface.

## **Core Features**

### **1. WhatsApp Integration**  
DeFiLink brings DeFi automation to your fingertips via **WhatsApp**. Communicate with the platform directly to initiate tasks like loans, token distribution, and liquidation—all without leaving your messaging app.

### **2. Flash Loans with NAVI Protocol**  
Seamlessly execute flash loans, borrow, and repay funds within a single transaction. Powered by **NAVI Protocol**, flash loan operations are automated and streamlined for efficiency.

### **3. Bulk Token Distribution**  
Distribute tokens, such as **NAVX**, to multiple addresses in bulk by simply uploading a CSV file. The platform automatically processes the distribution and handles all necessary transactions through the **NAVI Protocol**.

### **4. Liquidation Monitoring and Execution**  
Monitor borrowers' health factors and automatically trigger liquidations when the health factor falls below a predefined threshold. This is all facilitated by **Suilend** and **NAVI Protocol**, ensuring smooth execution of liquidations on the Sui blockchain.
